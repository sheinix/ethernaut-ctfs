# Hello Ethernaut (Tutorial) üëãüèª

First challenge is actually a simple and straightforward tutorial. Just have to follow the instructions on the challenge and interact with Ethernaut contract through the browser console.

As far as I can tell is meant to be just a training to get use to the contract api. You will be interacting with the contract level and the contract will be giving you instructions all the way for the next step.

I have recorded the answers in here, each of this answers are in response of "a clue" that the Smart Contract gives you.

1. `await contract.info`
2. `await contract.info1()`
3. `await contract.info2("hello")`
4. `fromWei(await contract.infoNum())`
5. `await contract.info42()`
6. `await contract.theMethodName()`
7. `await contract.method7123949()`
8. `await contract.password()`
9. `await contract.authenticate('ethernaut0')`

Once authenticated (you'll be prompted with a Metamask transaction) you can submit the instance an go the next level!
